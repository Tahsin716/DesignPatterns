Strategy Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each algorithm, and makes them interchangeable.

## What are the use cases of Strategy Design Pattern?

### 1. Sorting Algorithms:

Varying sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, bubblesort) based on different requirements.

### 2. File Compression:

Choosing different compression algorithms (e.g., ZIP, GZIP) based on file types or user preferences.

### 3. Payment Gateways:

Supporting different payment methods (credit card, PayPal, etc.) in an e-commerce application.

### 4. Graphics Rendering:
