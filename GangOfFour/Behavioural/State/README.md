# State

### What is the State Design Pattern?

State Design Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

## What are the use cases of the State Design Pattern?

### 1. Object with Multiple States:

When an object exhibits different behaviors based on its internal state.

### 2. Stateful Components:

When you want to model the behavior of a component with a finite set of well-defined states.

### 3. Workflow Systems:

In systems where an object goes through different states as it progresses through a workflow.

### 4. Game Characters:

Representing the behavior of characters in a game that can be in various states (e.g., attacking, defending, idle).
