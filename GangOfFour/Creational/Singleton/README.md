# Singleton

### What is the Singleton Design Pattern?

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational pattern that ensures a class has only **one instance** and provides a global access point to that instance. 


### What are the use cases of the Singleton Design Pattern?

It's useful for managing shared resources, configurations, or objects that should exist only once in an application.

For Example

- Managing configuration settings
- Handling database connections
- Logging systems
- Thread pools
- Resource access controllers
